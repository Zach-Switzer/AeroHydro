    "This is your [_AeroPython_](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython) assignment for the second course module, titled **\"Potential vortices and lift.\"** The first course module, \"Building blocks of potential flow\" (first three IPython Notebooks of the series) ended with the representation of potential flow around a 2D cylinder by means of superposing a doublet singularity and a free stream. And in the second module, you learned that adding a vortex singularity, you can get lift around the cylinder. You may ask: *is all this useful?* \n",

What can we do with this potential cylinder flow?\n",

    "Back in the years when computers were not available, fluid dynamicists and mathematicians used a powerful tool—complex analysis—to study potential flows without directly solving partial-differential governing equations. With the magic of complex analysis and the known solution of potential flow over a cylinder, they could easily obtain many kinds of external potential flows, including flows over several types of airfoils.\n",

In this assignment, we will guide you step by step to obtain potential flow over an airfoil starting with the flow over a cylinder and the famous conformal mapping called the **Joukowski transformation**. You will realize how important potential cylinder flow is in the history of aerodynamics!\n",

    "    2. How much is the lift and does it agree with the Kutta-Joukowski theorem? The lift, $L=-\\oint p \\times \\sin{\\theta} dA$, is perpendicular to the free-stream direction.\n",
    "    3. How much is the drag? The drag, $D=-\\oint p \\times \\cos{\\theta} dA$, is in the direction of the free-stream.\n",
    "    4. What are the index of the stagnation points on the airfoil? (We assume that the trailing edge is the $1^\\text{st}$ point and that we index the points counterclockwise.)\n",
    "    5. What is the velocity at the $92^\\text{nd}$ point on the airfoil? \n",
    "    6. What is the pressure coefficient at the $111^\\text{th}$ point on the airfoil?\n",
    "    7. Explain what is going on with the pressure coefficient at the trailing edge of the airfoil.\n",
