## Classical Aerodynamics with Python

The _AeroPython_ series of lessons is the core of a university course (Aerodynamics-Hydrodynamics, MAE-6226) by Prof. Lorena A. Barba at the George Washington University. The first version ran in Spring 2014 and these Jupyter Notebooks were prepared for that class, with assistance from Barba-group PhD student Olivier Mesnard. In Spring 2015, revised and extended the collection, adding student assignments to strengthen the learning experience. The course is also supported by an open learning space in the [GW SEAS Open edX](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/) platform.

## Dependencies

To use these lessons, you need Python 3, and the standard stack of scientific Python: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy. And of course, you need [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org)â€”an interactive computational environment that runs on a web browser.

This mini-course is built as a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/notebook.html) containing the written materials and worked-out solutions on Python code. To work with the material, we recommend that you start each lesson with a fresh new notebook, and follow along, typing each line of code (don't copy-and-paste!), and exploring by changing parameters and seeing what happens. 


#### Installing via Anaconda
We *highly* recommend that you install the [Anaconda Python Distribution](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install). It will make your life so much easier. 
You can download and install Anaconda on Windows, OSX, and Linux. 

After installing, to ensure that your packages are up to date, run the following commands in a terminal:

```Bash
conda update conda
conda update jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib
```

If you prefer Miniconda (a mini version of Anaconda that saves you disk space), install all the necessary libraries to follow this course by running the following commands in a terminal:

```Bash
conda update conda
conda install jupyter
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib
```


#### Without Anaconda
If you already have Python installed on your machine, you can install Jupyter using pip:

```Bash
pip install jupyter
```

Please also make sure that you have the necessary libraries installed by running

```Bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```


### Running the notebook server

Once Jupyter is installed, open up a terminal and then run 

```Bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will start up a Jupyter session in your browser!
